Worked for GoodGoodsCAN as a freelance full-stack developer to develop a multi-vendor e-commerce web app.

I transformed the ideas given to me into a demo application to be used in funding pitches.

The demo was created with Nuxt Js and included features for user authentication and profiles, a filtered feed for products, and a backend tool for businesses to create and curate products for the platform.
