Toado is a simple interactive task and project manager for the command line built in rust.

Toado is my first complete project built in rust and acted as a way for me to learn more about the language and it's workflow.
This was also my first time building a command line app and it taught me a lot about the thought and considerations that go into designing one.

        srcSet="/assets/images/projects/toado/toado_add_task.png"
        type="image/png"
    />

        src="/assets/images/projects/toado/toado_add_task.png"
        alt="Toado add task"
        title="Toado add task command"
    />

My goals were to create a simple but robust app with a workflow similar to that of other command line tools.

        srcSet="/assets/images/projects/toado/toado_list_tasks.webp"

    />

        src="/assets/images/projects/toado/toado_list_tasks.png"
        alt="Toado list tasks"
        title="Toado list tasks command"
    />

## Features

Some off the note worthy features I implemented were as follows:

- **CRUD** commands for tasks and projects
- A list command for listing tasks and projects
- Ability to configure command behaviour with flags
- Ability to assign tasks to projects
- A configuration file to customize the look and behavior of the app

Toado is still a *work in progress* so some of these features are incomplete and more features are planned to be added in the future.
